  ## Description
  The motivation for this was to create backend for a business so that they can have an organized place where all their stores' data can be stored. This helps them update, add, update, and delete any of their products, categories, and tags that the store is offering to their customers. I built this project so that I could showcase my newly learnt routing skills and also showcase my newly learnt Object Relational Mapping programming skills. The problem that my backend E-commerce store solves is having a digital, organized  platform to keep a business data. I have learned many things throughout the creation of this e-commerce backend homework, a few thing that I haved learned are the different availble routes. For example the delete route deletes a specific thing and the post creates a new thing. 
  ## Installation
  The first step was to install the npm packages. The next step I took was to use the require to use all the npm packages that I have installed. The first thing a user has to do use my terminal application is to "npm i" to install all the npm packages they will need to start my application. The second step is to log in into mysql and source the schema.sql file so that the database can be created and used. The next step for the installation is to run the seeds by inputting the command "node seeds/index.js" in the terminal. The last step is to run the server by inputting the command "node server.js". One important thing to remember is to set up a dot.env file that so the server knows what databse to use and your mysql root and password.
